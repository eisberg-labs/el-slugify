# node-el-slugify

Fast and efficient URL slug generator written in Rust.
Strings are sanitized and transliterated.

## Installation
```yaml
npm i --save node-el-slugify
```

## Installation in repository

Installing nodejs bindings require a [supported version of Node and Rust](https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon#platform-support).

This fully installs the project, including installing any dependencies and running the build.

## Building nodejs bindings

If you have already installed the project and only want to run the build, run:

```sh
npm run build
```

This command uses the [cargo-cp-artifact](https://github.com/neon-bindings/cargo-cp-artifact) utility to run the Rust build and copy the built library into `./build/Release/index.node`.
Prebuild requires that the binary is in `build/Release` as though it was built with node-gyp.

## Example
```javascript
const slugifier = require("node-el-slugify");

assert.strictEqual(slugifier.slugify('ma훾ka Ma훾ki Grize rep!'), 'macka-macki-grize-rep')
assert.strictEqual(slugifier.slugify_with_replacement('ma훾ka Ma훾ki Grize rep!', '_'), 'macka_macki_grize_rep')
```
